Indigo Disk's breakthrough exhibition came in 2015, when she showcased her work at the Saatchi Gallery in London. The exhibition, titled "Reflections," featured a series of large-scale paintings that explored the theme of self-reflection. The exhibition was a critical and commercial success, with many art critics praising Indigo Disk's unique artistic vision and her ability to connect with viewers on a deep emotional level. Indigo Disk's music and message resonate with young audiences who find solace and strength in her vulnerability. She actively engages with her fans online, fostering a supportive and inclusive community. Her advocacy for mental health awareness extends beyond her music, as she speaks out on the importance of seeking help and normalizing conversations about mental illness.
